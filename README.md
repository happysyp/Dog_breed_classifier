# Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App

In this project, a pipeline was built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to process real-world, user-supplied images. An algorithm was developed to be used as part of a mobile or web app. The code accepts any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

This project includes several separate steps:
Step 0: Import Datasets
Step 1: Detect Humans
Step 2: Detect Dogs
Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
Step 6: Write Algorithm
Step 7: Test Algorithm
